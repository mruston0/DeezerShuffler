# DeezerShuffler (WORK IN PROGRESS)

One of my favourite features often missing from music players and services these days is the ability to pick a random album and play the entire thing front to back.

This app uses the Deezer API to do just that. It loads in your list of your favourite albums, randomizes it, and starts playing them.
